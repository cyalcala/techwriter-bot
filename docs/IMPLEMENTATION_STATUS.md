# Implementation Status

This is the relay checkpoint for ongoing implementation work.

When starting a new chat, read these files first:

1. `docs/MASTER_EXECUTION_PLAN.md`
2. `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md`
3. `graphify-out/GRAPH_REPORT.md`

Then continue from the "Next Task" section below.

## Current Focus

Phase 1: Deploy and Harden.

The active slice is API hardening and deploy foundation:

- Request IDs on API responses.
- Standardized JSON error envelopes.
- Env-configurable chat rate limits.
- Safer input/body limits.
- First-pass provider health endpoint.
- PROJECT_NAME-based KV key prefixing.
- Deployment script foundation.
- Privacy-first durable content removal.
- Provider failover visibility without retained response content.
- Relay-safe documentation updates after each meaningful step.

## Approved Product Decision

On 2026-05-25, the user approved privacy-first behavior and the longer-term
Documentation Tooling Agent direction.

- Chat messages, uploads, generated responses, search-result content, and
  rendered artifact content must not be intentionally retained in durable
  application storage.
- Provider health, circuit state, aggregate token/cost/latency metrics, rate
  limits, request identifiers, and app-version markers may persist when they
  contain no user content.
- The former durable cached-response outage fallback is superseded. If live AI
  is unavailable, the application must return a clear retryable outage state;
  the open browser session may present an already-held in-memory response only.
- Future tool use must be bounded and user-controlled, not autonomous or
  background execution.

## Completed

- Created `docs/MASTER_EXECUTION_PLAN.md`.
- Built `graphify-out/GRAPH_REPORT.md` and `graphify-out/graph.json`.
- Confirmed the main graph hotspots:
  - `src/pages/api/chat.ts`
  - `src/lib/zen-router.ts`
  - `src/lib/search.ts`
  - `src/lib/rag-client.ts`
  - `src/lib/rag-db.ts`
  - artifact parser/components.
- Added `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md` as the relay checkpoint.
- Added shared API response helpers in `src/lib/api-response.ts`.
- Migrated `src/pages/api/chat.ts` GET/POST responses to include `x-request-id` and standardized API error envelopes on the main chat paths.
- Added env-configurable request limits in `src/lib/request-limits.ts`:
  - `RATE_LIMIT_PER_MINUTE`, default `30`.
  - `RATE_LIMIT_PER_DAY`, default `500`.
  - `CHAT_MAX_CHARS`, default `4000`.
  - `MAX_REQUEST_BODY_BYTES`, default `5242880`.
- Added `PROJECT_NAME` KV key prefix helper in `src/lib/kv-prefix.ts`.
- Applied the KV prefix to operational state and earlier legacy content paths;
  privacy-first work disables new durable RAG/response-content persistence.
- Added provider health helper in `src/lib/provider-health.ts`.
- Added `/api/health` to live-ping configured providers with one-token requests.
- Added `.env.template` with provider/deploy links and Phase 1 safety limits.
- Added `deploy.sh` foundation:
  - Loads `.env`.
  - Creates/updates the `SESSION` KV namespace binding.
  - Validates configured provider keys with one-token pings.
  - Writes `APP_VERSION` to prefixed KV.
  - Builds and prepares the Cloudflare Pages worker bundle.
  - Deploys and prints the expected Pages URL.
- Made Cloudflare remote bindings opt-in via `CLOUDFLARE_REMOTE_BINDINGS=true` so local builds do not require Wrangler login.
- Migrated all current API route JSON responses to shared helpers:
  - `src/pages/api/embed.ts`
  - `src/pages/api/rag-store.ts`
  - `src/pages/api/render-artifact.ts`
  - `src/pages/api/search-credits.ts`
  - `src/pages/api/debug.ts`
  - `src/pages/api/debug-ai.ts`
  - `src/pages/api/summarize.ts`
  - Existing `chat.ts`/`health.ts` helper usage is covered by tests.
- An earlier query-cache response path was hardened for SSE shape; the approved
  privacy-first direction now requires that durable response-cache path to stay
  disabled.
- Added `src/tests/api-routes-consistency.test.ts` to guard against hand-built JSON API responses.
- Added CSP and browser hardening headers through `src/lib/security-headers.ts` and `src/middleware.ts`.
- Added sandbox/referrer-policy attributes for HTML, React, and WebContainer artifact iframes.
- Fixed local API origin validation to use the shared exact-match CSRF helper,
  permitting the `127.0.0.1` preview origin while rejecting prefix lookalikes.
- Fixed WebContainer loading to use the published ESM module entrypoint and
  added the documented `credentialless` COOP/COEP isolation headers.
- Added timestamped provider failover events and surfaced recent failovers in
  the chat footer without retaining generated response content.
- Confirmed the all-providers-unavailable path returns the standardized
  retryable `AI_PROVIDERS_UNAVAILABLE` response without a durable answer cache.
- Added content-free hourly provider telemetry in `src/lib/provider-telemetry.ts`
  for path class, outcome, latency, status, and aggregate token budget only.
- Prefixed aggregate token-usage KV buckets with `PROJECT_NAME` so operational
  telemetry follows the same deployment isolation rule as other durable state.
- Added `src/lib/app-version.ts` and `src/pages/api/version.ts` for KV `APP_VERSION` mismatch detection; current privacy-first work updates its recovery guidance to remove legacy content and retain only non-content operational state.
- Included APP_VERSION status in `/api/health`; mismatches make health return unavailable.
- Pushed verified Phase 1 checkpoint `4163d77` to
  `origin/codex/privacy-first-disclosure`.

## In Progress

- Phase 1 foundations are partially implemented.
- The `codex/privacy-first-disclosure` branch is backed up on GitHub through
  checkpoint `4163d77` and now contains a verified content-free telemetry
  follow-up slice.
- WebContainer now enters an isolated boot path without CSP errors; a complete
  Vite preview did not finish during local verification because its external
  package fetches reported transient network failures.
- Remaining Phase 1 work should focus on runtime/manual verification,
  completion of the WebContainer runtime check, optional open-session-only
  continuity during provider outages, and deeper deploy hardening.

## Blockers And Notes

- Active branch: `codex/privacy-first-disclosure`.
- Create verified GitHub checkpoint pushes on this feature branch as coherent
  slices complete; do not commit scratch/generated local artifacts.
- There are unrelated/unmanaged untracked local artifacts in the workspace. Do not delete them unless the user explicitly asks.
- A same-shell `subst T:` alias lets the build run.
- Build requires `CLOUDFLARE_REMOTE_BINDINGS` to stay unset or `false` unless Wrangler is logged in.
- Local build currently emits non-failing Node `punycode`/`MaxListenersExceeded`
  warnings plus the Wrangler local-AI remote-usage warning.

## Verification Log

Latest integrated verification on 2026-05-25:

- `npm.cmd test` passed: 14 test files, 63 tests.
- The privacy audit returned no durable content-write matches:

```powershell
rg -n "localStorage\.setItem|indexedDB\.open|rag:\$\{|qcache:|kroki:|searchCache\.set|query:\s*query|from '../../lib/query-cache'|searchRagKV" src -g "!tests"
```

- Representative API checks returned `x-request-id` headers and structured
  envelopes: invalid `/api/chat` request `400 INVALID_REQUEST`, disabled
  `/api/rag-store` persistence `410 CONTENT_RETENTION_DISABLED`, and
  `/api/health` `503` while its version marker requires privacy-safe migration.
- Local browser checks at `http://127.0.0.1:4321/` confirmed the privacy
  notice opens/closes at desktop and mobile widths and closes on Escape.
  `localStorage` and `sessionStorage` remained empty after an artifact chat.
- A fresh browser check found and fixed a Google Fonts CSP violation and the
  loopback-origin API rejection. HTML and deterministic React artifact
  previews render with zero CSP errors. A deterministic WebContainer fixture
  now loads the published API module with `crossOriginIsolated === true` and
  no CSP errors; full preview completion remains open due to external package
  network failures observed during its install.
- Build passed with:

```powershell
subst T: C:\Users\admin\Desktop\techwriter-bot; Set-Location -LiteralPath 'T:\'; $env:NODE_OPTIONS='--preserve-symlinks --preserve-symlinks-main'; $env:CLOUDFLARE_REMOTE_BINDINGS='false'; npm.cmd run build:local
```

- Build completed successfully with non-failing warnings noted above.

Latest incremental verification on 2026-05-26:

- `npm.cmd test` passed: 16 test files, 65 tests, including privacy-safe
  provider telemetry and project-prefixed aggregate token usage.
- The privacy audit above again returned no durable content-write matches.
- The recorded `build:local` command above passed after the telemetry wiring,
  with only the already-noted non-failing warnings.

## Next Task

Continue Phase 1 with runtime verification and zero-downtime hardening:

- Complete the WebContainer Vite preview runtime check once the external
  package-network path is stable.
- Continue Zero-Downtime AI Pipeline work:
  - Optional open-session-only continuity when all providers fail.
- If the latest verified telemetry commit is not yet on GitHub, push it before
  continuing with deeper privacy-compatible deploy/runtime hardening.

## Continue Prompt

Use this in a new chat if the session stops:

```text
Continue from C:\Users\admin\Desktop\techwriter-bot. Read docs\MASTER_EXECUTION_PLAN.md, docs\IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md, and graphify-out\GRAPH_REPORT.md first. Then continue Phase 1 from docs\IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md Next Task. Use the build verification command recorded there. Do not rebuild OAuth, Stripe, multi-tenancy, email, marketing pages, autonomous agents, Kubernetes, Redis, or complex dashboards.
```
